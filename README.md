All you should have to do is place a text file named dir_path.txt in the same folder as the executable and type/paste the path to your VTOL VR RadioMusic folder into it. On windows it will probably end with something like this \steamapps\common\VTOL VR\RadioMusic\\

After that, run the executable and it will randomize the order that the files appear in by adding a tag and a number to the beginning of the filenames, which will shuffle them in game while keeping the filenames human-readable. I beleive this will only work once per launching of the game so you'll still have to do some song skipping when you respawn and load the radio back on. 

This code will only modify files that end in ".mp3" so you may need to rename your songs to include that suffix.

Maybe use some caution when using someone else's code to modify your computer's files

All I can say is it works on my machine ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
