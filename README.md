All you should have to do is place a text file named dir_path.txt in the same folder as the executable and type/paste the path to your VTOL VR RadioMusic folder into it. On winbows it will probably end with something like this \steamapps\common\VTOL VR\RadioMusic\\

After that, all you should have to do is run the executable and it should shuffle the order that the files appear in, which will shuffle them in game. I beleive this will only work once per launching of the game so you'll still have to do some song skipping when you respawn and load the radio back on. 

Maybe use some caution when using someone else's code to modify your computer's files

All I can say is it works on my machine ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
